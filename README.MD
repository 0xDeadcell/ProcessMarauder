## ABOUT
ProcessMarauder is a Python library for DLL injection, built off of the GH Injector DLL. It provides a command line interface for injecting DLLs into running processes and includes optional arguments for specifying the injection mode, launch method, and cloaking options. The library also offers the ability to download PDB files and DLLs for the GH Injector library, and to check for updates to the library. It requires the user to specify the path to the DLL to inject and the ID or name of the target process.
